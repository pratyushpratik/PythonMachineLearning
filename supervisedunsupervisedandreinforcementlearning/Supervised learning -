Supervised learning - 
	certain data set and we need to predict as close as close value.

	- k nearest neighbour
	- logistic regression


Unsupervised learning-
	we don't need to predict any target, value or estimation instead we try to predict clustering of that

	- k means algorithm


Reinforcement learning -
	we try to train our model on environment which learn from trail and error and again reinforce to learn better
